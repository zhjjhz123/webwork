                <h3>Tea Culture Activities</h3>
                <p style="background-color: aqua;">
                    <i>Jingshan Tea Ceremony is a folk activity popular in Yuhang District, Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, and is one of the national intangible cultural heritages.
                    </i></p> <p>Originating from Wanshou Zen Temple on Jingshan Mountain in Jingshan Town, Yuhang District, the Jingshan Tea Ceremony began in the Tang Dynasty, flourished in the Song Dynasty, and has been passed down to this day. It is a unique tea-drinking ritual of the ancient Jingshan temple, where tea is used in place of wine to entertain guests. The ceremony consists of more than ten procedural steps, including posting the tea list, beating the tea drum, respectfully inviting guests into the hall, offering incense and paying respects to Buddha, boiling water and making tea, serving tea, reciting verses while drinking tea, and expressing gratitude and leaving the hall. Through the use of "participating in conversation topics" for dialogue between guests and hosts or between teachers and students, witty and enlightening remarks are exchanged. The essence and core of the Jingshan Tea Ceremony lie in the practice of Zen through tea, seeking wisdom and understanding.</p>
