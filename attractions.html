                  West Lake, also known as Qiantang Lake, is located at No. 1 Longjing Road, Xihu District, Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China, and is one of the three famous lakes in Jiangnan. It is surrounded by mountains on its south, west, and north sides, with the urban area to its east and adjacent to Qiantang River to the south across the mountains.

                  The lake is divided into several water surfaces by the Bai Causeway, Su Causeway, Yang Causeway, and Zhao Causeway, and it also contains three islands. The West Lake Scenic Area is centered around West Lake and can be divided into four levels from near to far.

                  The annual runoff within the West Lake basin is 1.4 million cubic meters, with a water storage capacity of nearly 1.4 million cubic meters. West Lake is a well-equipped and well-managed reservoir for irrigation and water transport, providing ample water resources for the fields in Hangzhou City and its surrounding areas through its channels and sluice gates. It also helps regulate the water level of Qiantang River, preventing urban flooding.

                  In 2007, the Hangzhou West Lake Scenic Area was rated as a "National AAAAA Scenic Spot". On June 24, 2011, the West Lake Cultural Landscape was inscribed on the "World Heritage List".
